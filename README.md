# CompilerDesign
This project is created for CS 410 - Intro to Compiler Design class. The compiler is designed to compile MATHY - a programming language similar to C++ that can support mathematical expressions. Flex and Bison are used to implement the compiler.

The bash scripts are created in MacOS, if a different OS is using, simply use all the commands in those scripts
- run.bash: contain script to compile mathy.l and mathy.y to produce mathy_exe. To use the compiler in terminal: ./mathy_exe programname. The scripts inside this file are: 
```
bison mathy.y
bison -d mathy.y -o mathy.cpp
flex -o mathy_lex.cpp mathy.l
g++ -o mathy_exe mathy.cpp mathy_lex.cpp
```
      
- clean.bash: remove all files generated by run.bash (.cpp, .hpp and .c files). It's not required since running run.bash again will relace them.

All .mathy files are testcases (sample programs written in MATHY) which can be used to test the compiler. For example, to run example.mathy in terminal: ./mathy_exe example.mathy

# Development Log
Dec 17,2020 - 9:40 - fixed display issue with fraction. Now all fractions should be displayed normally.
